    "# 1.What exactly is []?\n",
    "Ans: [] is used to represent an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "Ans: we can assign it using:\n",
    "\tSpam[2]=’hello’\n",
    "This will give an output:\n",
    "[2,4,’hello’,8,10]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "Ans: The value of spam[int(int(‘3’*2)//11] is spam[3], therefore the value is ‘d’.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "Ans: ‘d’ is the value of  spam[-1].\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "Ans: The value of spam[:2] is [‘a’, ‘b’].\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Ans: The value of bacon.index(‘cat’) is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "Ans: The append method adds a new element in the end of the list, bacon.append(99) will give the output ->[3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True,99].\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8.How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Ans: bacon.remove(‘cat’) remove the element ‘cat’ from the list. The output will be:[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9.What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Ans: The list concatenation operator is  ‘+’ and the list replication operator is ‘*’.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10.What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "Ans: append() method adds elements only to the end of the list ,whereas insert() method can be used to insert a element anywhere in the list.\n",
    " \n",
    "# 11.What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans: The del statement and the remove() method are two ways to remove values from a list\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12.Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Ans:Both strings and lists can have indexes and be sliced, they can be used in for loops, they both are sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13.What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans:Lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable. List uses square brackets [] , while tuples uses parenthesis ().\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14.How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans: We  can write it as: (42,) comma is necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15.How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "Ans: We can use a list() and tuple() functions to change a tuple into a list and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16.Variables that “contain”  list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Ans: They contain references to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17.How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Ans: The copy.copy() will create a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list also."
