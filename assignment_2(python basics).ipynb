    "# 1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Ans: Boolean data type has 2 types: True and False\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans: There are three basic Boolean search commands: AND, OR and NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Make a list of each Boolean operator’s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "Ans: True and True is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "True and False is False.\n",

    "# 5.What are the six comparison operators?\n",
    "Ans: The six comparison operators are:==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Ans: we use ‘=’ (assignment operator) to assign a value to the variable, whereas the ‘==’(equal to operator) checks whether the two given operands are equal or not, If they are equal it returns True otherwise it return False.\n",

    "# 9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?\n",
    "Ans: We press ctrl+c if a program is stuck in a endless loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10.How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "Ans:When we use the break statement it will break the execution and move it outside and just after a loop, whereas the continue statement will move the execution to the start of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11.In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "Ans:The range (10) means it calls range from 0 to 9, The range (0,10) also means that it calls range from 0 to 9 with the starting value being 0, The range (0,10,1) means it calls range from 0 to 9 at the intervals of 1. They all do the same thing in different methods.\n",

    "Ans: If we had a function named bacon() inside module named spam, we can call it using spam.bacon()."
